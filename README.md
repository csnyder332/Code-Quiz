# Code-Quiz

# I created a quiz site that is timed(Incorrect answers deduct ten seconds), and houses high scores. High scores are viewable via a button. 

AS a coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

  GIVEN I am taking a code quiz  
   WHEN I click the start button  
  THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question  
   WHEN I answer a question  
  THEN I am presented with another question  
   WHEN I answer a question incorrectly  
  THEN time is subtracted from the clock  
   WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0  
  THEN the game is over  
   WHEN the game is over  
  THEN I can save my initials and score
